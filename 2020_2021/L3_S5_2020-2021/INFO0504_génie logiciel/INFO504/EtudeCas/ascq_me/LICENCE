This software is a computer program whose purpose is to identify proteins
by peptide mass fingerprinting. Its scoring is based on spectral correlation
between an experimental MS spectrum and theoretical MS spectra. The experimental
spectrum is a mass spectrum without mono isotopic mass extraction. Theoretical
spectra are generated from proteins in FASTA format thanks to an algorithm
based on Fast Fourier Transform.
