  This software is a computer program whose purpose is to identify proteins
  by peptide mass fingerprinting. Its scoring is based on spectral correlation
  between an experimental MS spectrum and theoretical MS spectra. The experimental
  spectrum is a mass spectrum without mono isotopic mass extraction. Theoretical
  spectra are generated from proteins in FASTA format thanks to an algorithm
  based on Fast Fourier Transform.
