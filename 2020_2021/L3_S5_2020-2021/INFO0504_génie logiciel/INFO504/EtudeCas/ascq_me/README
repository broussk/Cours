Thank you for downloading ASCQ_ME.

UNIX System:
Try to type "make" on your terminal. It launches a compilation with the standard
g++ compiler. But you can also type:
    make clean ==> to remove all the compiled file (ascq_me, .o and also the result files).
    make clean all ==> to remove the documentation too.
    make doc ==> for generating the documentation (if you have doxygen).

WINDOWS Systems:
For windows user, we do not have an install method available but the application has been tested on Windows 2000 with
visual studio. Try to create a project including all the .h and the .cpp of the src directory. Then put the result of the compilation
in the root directory of ascq_me. Open a terminal, go to the ascq_me directory and let's go.

MAC OS Systems:
There is not a version for these systems. Sorry.

NB: in future versions, ASCQ_ME will use CMAKE in order to be easily used on a lot of a heterogeneous systems.

General:

For using ascq_me, directly type:
ascq_me configuration_file

You have configuration files already available in the _configuration directory.

You can also add two options after the configuration file:
    ==> -v for a verbose mode.
    ==> -xml for having the results in an xml format (use by the on-line version).
